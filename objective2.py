    The bar chart shows the relationship between education level and the adoption of water harvesting. 
    The chart can be seen as that people with no formal education have the highest number of adopters and followed by those with primary education. 
    In contrast, the number of adopters decreases as the level of education increases with the lowest adoption seen among individuals with secondary and college or university education. 
    This suggests that people with lower levels of education are more likely to adopt water harvesting practices because they rely more on traditional or self-sufficient methods for water use.

    The chart shows that both groups have a similar median land size, meaning the typical amount of land owned is almost the same whether a household practices low-level agroforestry or none at all. 
    However, the spread of land sizes is wider for the ‚ÄúNone‚Äù group with several households owning significantly larger plots as shown by the outliers above the main box.
