    The bar chart shows the relationship between education level and the adoption of water harvesting. 
    The chart can be seen as that people with no formal education have the highest number of adopters and followed by those with primary education. 
    In contrast, the number of adopters decreases as the level of education increases with the lowest adoption seen among individuals with secondary and college or university education. 
    This suggests that people with lower levels of education are more likely to adopt water harvesting practices because they rely more on traditional or self-sufficient methods for water use.

    In contrast, married individuals are fewer in number and generally show lower levels of perception, with very few having a high perception.

    The majority of households of **77.8%**, do not have any land use plan, while only **22.2%** have one. 
    This means that most households are not planning or organizing how their land is used. 
    The chart makes it clear that only a small portion of households are taking steps to manage their land properly. 
    This could mean that many people may not be aware of the benefits of land planning or may not have the resources to do it.
    Overall, the chart highlights a need for more support or awareness to help households create land use plans.
