    This analysis explores key aspects of sustainable agricultural practices among freehold households. 
    The **Land Size vs. Water Harvesting Adoption** visualization highlights how larger landholders are more likely to adopt water harvesting techniques, indicating resource capacity influences sustainability choices. 
    **Access to Training by Membership to Community Organizations** shows that members of community groups have significantly greater access to agricultural training, emphasizing the role of social networks in knowledge dissemination. 
    The **Distribution of Soil Condition Trends** reveals varying soil quality trends, suggesting differences in land management practices. 
    Finally, the **Correlation Heatmap** identifies strong relationships between education, land size, and adoption of climate-smart practices, providing insights into the socio-economic and environmental factors driving agricultural resilience.

    This bar chart shows the relationship between access to training and membership in a community organization. 
    It reveals that people who are **not members** of any community organization mostly **do not have access to training** with a much larger number lacking access compared to those who receive it. 
    Meanwhile, those who **are members** still have more people without access rather than with access but the difference is small. 
    This suggests that being part of a community organization improves the chances of receiving training although many members still miss out, showing there is room for better training to outreach even within organized groups.

    Meanwhile, up to **35.8%** of households reported that their soil condition has **not changed**, implying stability but no improvement in soil quality.
