   The histogram for **‚ÄúDistribution of Age among Freehold Household Heads‚Äù** shows how the ages of people who own freehold land are spread out.
   Most household heads are between age **45 and 60 years old** with the highest number around age **50 years old**. 
   This means that freehold land is mostly owned by middle-aged individuals. The average (mean) and middle (median) ages are both around the age of **50 years**, showing that most data is centered in this range.
   The **first quartile (Q1)** is about **40 years** and the **third quartile (Q3)** is about **60 years** also giving an **interquartile range (IQR)** of around **20 years**. 
   This tells that half of the household heads are between 40 and 60 years old. The chart also shows a few older owners above 70 years, but very few younger ones below 35. Overall, the data suggests that middle-aged people are the main holders of freehold land.
